    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: Feb 20, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the "Unpredictable Runner" Chrome Extension and Web Game. We are committed to
        protecting your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Our extension acts simply as a shortcut to launch the "Unpredictable Runner" web game. <strong>We do not collect,
            store, or transmit any personal information or usage data through the Chrome Extension itself.</strong></p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services (Web Game)</h2>
    <p>When you click the extension to play the game on the web, you are directed to our Firebase-hosted site. That site
        utilizes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> To measure web traffic and game engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>Google AdSense:</strong> To serve advertisements when a player crashes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These third-party services may use cookies and collect data as outlined in Google's privacy policies. The Chrome
        Extension itself does NOT inject ads or read your browsing history.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer via GitHub.</p>
